Current Situation: The website has a footer with three columns (Product, Company, Legal) and several links, as shown in the user's screenshot. Currently, none of these links do anything when clicked.

Your Task: Modify the HTML, CSS (within <style> tags), and JavaScript (within <script> tags) to implement the following functionality for every link in the footer.

1. Add id Attributes to Existing HTML Sections: First, find the existing content sections in the HTML and add these id attributes so you can scroll to them:

Add id="features" to the main "Features" or "How It Works" section.

Add id="specifications" to the "Technical Specifications" table section.

Add id="demo-form" to the final "Ready to Transform Your Farm?" section that contains the contact form.

2. Implement JavaScript Click Listeners for All Footer Links:

You must add JavaScript event listeners for each link. Use the logic below to determine the action for each link:

Links that scroll to a section:

Features: On click, scroll smoothly to the #features section.

Specifications: On click, scroll smoothly to the #specifications section.

Request Demo: On click, scroll smoothly to the #demo-form section.

Contact: On click, scroll smoothly to the #demo-form section.

(Use element.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' }) for this.)

Links that open a modal pop-up:

For all other links, you will create and display a modal window.

Create one generic modal structure in the HTML (e.g., <div id="modal-container" class="hidden ...">...</div>).

This modal should be styled with Tailwind CSS to be a dark-mode-friendly pop-up, centered on the screen, with a dark background overlay and a "Close" (X) button.

When a link (e.g., "Pricing") is clicked, your JavaScript should:

Update the modal's title and content with the specific text for that link (see content below).

Display the modal (remove the hidden class).

The "Close" (X) button and clicking the background overlay must hide the modal.

3. Content for Modals:

Use the following content when building the modals for each link:
