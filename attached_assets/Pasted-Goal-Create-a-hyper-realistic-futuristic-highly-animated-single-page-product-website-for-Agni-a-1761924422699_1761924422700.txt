Goal:
Create a hyper-realistic, futuristic, highly animated single-page product website for Agni — a novel soil-scanner device (an original invention). The site should sell the device’s precision, AI analytics, and real-world farm value. Build with modern web stack and production standards so the output from Replit is immediately runnable, editable, and deployable.

Must-have tech stack & libs:

React (Vite) or Next.js (prefer Vite for simplicity), TypeScript preferred.

Tailwind CSS for styling.

Framer Motion for UI micro-interactions.

Three.js (or react-three-fiber) for a rotatable 3D model of the Agni device (placeholder GLB provided).

Lottie for vector micro-animations (for sensors, data flow).

Mapbox GL JS or Leaflet for interactive field heatmap demo (static demo data).

Recharts (or Chart.js) for animated charts.

Optional: GSAP for timeline animations (if required).

Build + Deploy scripts (npm run dev, build, preview).

Design directions:

Visual language: ultra-clean, futuristic, tactile tech. Emphasize realism (material shaders on 3D model), subtle particle/data flow animations, and polished micro-interactions.

Tone: confident, scientific, farmer-friendly — "lab-grade but for the field".

Layout: single page with sections (Hero, Problem, Solution, How it Works, Live Demo (3D + Map), Key Specs, Use Cases, Integrations, CTA, Footer).

Color palette (futuristic & high-contrast):

Primary deep background (graphite): #0B0F1A (almost-black navy)

Primary accent (electric cyan/teal): #00F0FF

Secondary accent (neon magenta): #FF2D9C

Gradient highlight: linear-gradient(90deg, #00F0FF 0%, #6DE8FF 45%, #FF2D9C 100%)

Metallic mid tone (steel): #2B3240

Soft surface (glass/plate): rgba(255,255,255,0.03) for cards

CTA (energetic): #00E6A8 (button hover variant #00FFC2)

Text primary: #E6F0FF (off-white for readability)

Text muted: #9AA7B2

Typography:

Headline: Inter or Manrope, weight 700–900, large letter spacing for hero.

Body: Inter / Source Sans Pro, comfortable line-height (1.6).

Use variable fonts if available.

Hero content (exact copy — use as canonical):

Headline: “Agni — Laboratory-Grade Soil Intelligence, Field-Ready”

Subhead: “One probe. Meter-by-meter soil data. AI recommendations you can act on.”

CTA primary: “Request Demo”

CTA secondary: “See Live Demo”

Micro copy examples for sections (short snippets):

Problem line: “Most decisions on farms happen blind — Agni makes the soil speak.”

Feature bullets: “Real-time moisture (%) · pH & nutrients · Geolocated variability maps · VM recommendations”

Trustline: “Developed for Indian soils — field-calibrated, rugged, and ready.”

UX & interactions:

Hero: center 3D model of Agni device (draggable rotation, slow auto-rotate). When user hovers/clicks a sensor area on the model show a tooltip panel with sensor specs (pH probe, NIR sensor, EC sensor).

Device → Data Flow Animation: animate tiny particles moving from the probe into a cloud icon and into a dashboard card (use Three.js particle system or Lottie).

Map demo: interactive heatmap with a timeline slider — animates soil moisture changes across the field.

Charts: animated line + area charts showing trends; on hover show precise values and a small inspector card with actionable tip (“Zone A: apply 12% less N”).

Scrolling: use scroll-triggered reveals and parallax for soil layers (different speeds for surface, subsoil & bedrock layers).

Buttons: subtle glassy neumorphic style with cyan glow on hover. Use motion for pressed state.

Micro-interactions: icon morphs, micro delays (40–120ms) and spring physics for motion.

Accessibility & performance:

All interactive elements keyboard accessible and ARIA labelled.

Ensure 3D model falls back to static hero image on low-power devices; lazy load GLB or use <Suspense>.

Use compressed GLB (Draco) and optimized Lottie JSONs.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion: disable auto-rotate/large motions if user prefers reduced motion.

Contrast checks: ensure text on backgrounds meets WCAG AA.

Content mapping (sections + behavior):

Hero — 3D model, headline, two CTAs, short benefit bullets.

Problem — three card highlights with subtle hover animations.

Solution (Agni) — pictorial stacked cards describing sensor suite + calibration + Megha integration.

How it works — animated 4-step horizontal timeline (Deploy → Capture → Analyze → Act).

Live Demo — interactive 3D + small dashboard + heatmap. Use sample CSV/JSON (provide 12–20 sample data points).

Specs & Accuracy — table with sensor specs and accuracy lines (e.g., Moisture ±0.5%, pH ±0.1 etc).

Use Cases & ROI — short bullets, CTA to download datasheet.

Integrations — icons for ISOBUS, API, mobile app, CSV export.

CTA strip — full width gradient with small form (email + farm area + request type).

Footer — legal, privacy, contact.

Developer deliverables (what Replit must produce):

Complete project scaffold (package.json, tsconfig, tailwind.config).

Components: Hero, Device3D, MapDemo, ChartPanel, FeatureGrid, SpecTable, CTAForm, Footer.

Assets: placeholder GLB for device (name: agni-device.glb), sample JSON data sample-field-data.json, 3 Lottie animations data-flow.json, sensor-pulse.json, map-blob.json.

README with run & deploy instructions (dev, build, preview).

API stubs: /api/demo-data returning sample-field-data.json.

Deploy: Vercel/Replit launch config instructions.

Code quality & best practices:

Use functional components, hooks, and clear folder structure: src/components, src/pages, src/styles, src/assets, src/lib.

Use Tailwind utility classes with CSS variables for color tokens.

TypeScript types for sensor data & map coordinates.

Add eslint + prettier config.

Unit test example for a simple util (optional).

Animations & visual assets suggestions:

3D device with PBR metallic shader, soft rim lights (cyan + magenta) to match palette.

Particle trails from probe → cloud using small glow sprites.

Lottie micro-animations for sensor widgets.

Soft glass cards with blurred background (backdrop-filter) and faint neon edges.

Performance & fallback:

Lazy load heavy libs (three.js, mapbox).

Provide static image fallback for hero and interactive demo for mobile.

Use gzip / Brotli for production and optimized images/webp.

Legal & copy notes:

Add short statement: “Agni — intellectual property of Mitti-AI. For demo purposes only.”

Privacy: link to data ownership — “Farmers own their data.”

Sample commit message (first commit):
feat: initial Agni product site scaffold — hero, 3D placeholder, map demo, animations, tailwind setup

Sample Hero CTAs and microcopy (ready to paste):

Primary CTA: “Request Demo” (opens modal)

Secondary CTA: “Try Live Demo” (scrolls to demo)

Microcopy under hero: “Meter-by-meter soil intelligence. Field-ready, lab-accurate insights — built by Mitti-AI.”

Final notes for generator:

Make the site feel original: avoid copying competitor layouts; aim for a tactile tech feel.

Prioritize a seamless first impression: hero + 3D + animated data flow must be visible above the fold on desktop.

Keep code modular so design/animation tweaks are easy.
